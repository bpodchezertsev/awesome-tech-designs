WIG
===

WIG = Wing-In-Ground(effect)
also GEV = Ground-Effect Vehicle, wingship, seaglider, ekranoplan

According to Wikipedia, The International Maritime Organization recognizes three types of WIGs:
- A-Type WIG: A craft which is certified for operation only in ground effect;
- B-Type WIG: A craft which is certified to temporarily increase its altitude to a limited height outside the influence of ground effect but not exceeding 150 m (490 ft) above the surface; and
- C-Type WIG: A craft which is certified for operation outside ground effect and exceeding 150 m (490 ft) above the surface.

Classic WIG designs are plagued with problems. Something new in design is needed to avoid these problems.
Will anyone win this design challenge?

Note: This list does not include small WIGs.

# Viceroy

eWIG with hydrofoil.

Project highlights usage of a hydrofoil, a high aspect ratio wing, and multiple engines.

Possible WIG type is unknown, but I predict at least B-Type WIG and possible C-Type WIG.

Numbers built: 1

Status: Undergoing sea trials.

Top: The largest WIG undergoing sea trials.

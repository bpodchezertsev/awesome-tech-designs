### Abstract

WIG = Wing-In-Ground(effect)
also GEV = Ground-Effect Vehicle, wingship, seaglider, ekranoplan

Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-effect_vehicle>

---
According to Wikipedia, The International Maritime Organization recognizes three types of WIGs:

#### A-Type
A craft which is certified for operation only in ground effect.

#### B-Type
A craft which is certified to temporarily increase its altitude to a limited height outside the influence of ground effect but not exceeding 150 m (490 ft) above the surface.

#### C-Type
A craft which is certified for operation outside ground effect and exceeding 150 m (490 ft) above the surface.

Classic WIG designs are plagued with problems. Something new in design is needed to avoid these problems.
Will anyone win this design challenge?

Note: This list does not include small WIGs.

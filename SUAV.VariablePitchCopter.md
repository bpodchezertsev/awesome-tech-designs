SUAV:Variable pitch copter
==========================

Variable pitch rotors can provide:
- fuel savings by changing the pitch depending on airspeed and engine RPM
- rapid thrust changes
- reverse thrust
  (In some cases, not all of these capabilities can be achieved in a single propeller or propeller/motor combination.)

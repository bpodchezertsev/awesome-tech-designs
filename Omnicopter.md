Omnicopter
==========

An Omnicopter is a copter that can provide thrust in all directions (6 degrees of freedom).
This allows it to move in any direction without having to tilt, and it can hover at an arbitrary tilt angle.

A partial omnicopter has limited degrees of freedom. For example:
only 1 additional rotation axis in addition to a normal copter; or limited degrees of rotation in all or some axes.
A special case of a partial omnicopter is a stable horizontal copter with no tilt during acceleration/deceleration or in windy conditions.
Of course, full omnicopters can do this too.

Some actual variations of omnicopters (full and partial) you can see in that videos:

## SUAV



## Voliro

Partial omnicopter.

Project highlights tiltrotor bicopter with additional orientation thruster.

Note: Possibility to rotate around pitch axis at almost 360 degrees, but continuous rotation is not allowed.

Status: In operation.

Foldable: The drone can be transported through a 50 cm (20 in) manhole by
detaching the tail, payload, and bumpers.

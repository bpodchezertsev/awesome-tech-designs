[&#9776;](readme.md#categories): Omnicopter
===========================================

An Omnicopter is a copter that can provide thrust in all directions (6 degrees of freedom).
This allows it to move in any direction without having to tilt, and it can hover at an arbitrary tilt angle.

A partial omnicopter has limited degrees of freedom. For example:
only 1 additional rotation axis in addition to a normal copter; or limited degrees of rotation in all or some axes.

A special case of a partial omnicopter is a stable horizontal copter with no tilt during acceleration/deceleration or in windy conditions.
Of course, full omnicopters can do this too.

Some actual variations of omnicopters (full and partial) you can see in that videos:

Video of a game, where you control full-symmetric 6 degrees of freedom vehicle with first person view:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f81U-EXSS3g>
Free version of this game is available: <https://store.steampowered.com/app/450220/Overload_Playable_Teaser_30/>

List of games with 6 degrees of freedom: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_games_with_6_degrees_of_freedom>

Regular copter can do:
- Move without tilting: 1 axis (up-down)
- Change orientation without move: 1 axis (vertical axis (yaw))

Full omnicopter can do:
- Move without tilting: 3 axis (up-down, forward-backward, left-right)
- Change orientation without move: 3 axis (yaw, pitch, roll)

All copters, who has more degree of freedom than regular copter, and lesser, then in full omnicopter, are partial omnicopters.

For example, all compound helicopters can move in 2 axis (up-down, forward) without tilting,
so they can be classified as a partial horizontal omnicopters.

#### Paper: Design and Control of an Omnidirectional Aerial Robot with a Miniaturized Haptic Joystick for Physical Interaction

##### Abstract:

Fully actuated aerial robot proved their superiority for Aerial Physical Interaction (APhI) over the past years.
This work proposes a minimal setup for aerial telemanipulation, enhancing accessibility of these technologies.
The design and the control of a 6-DoF joystick with 4-DoF haptic feedback is detailed.
It is the first haptic device with standard Remote Controller (RC) form factor for APhI.
By miniaturizing haptic device, it enhances RC with the sense of touch, increasing physical awareness.
The goal is to give operators an extra sense, other than vision and sound, to help to perform safe APhI.
To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first teleoperation system able to decouple each single axis input command.
On the omnidirectional quadrotor, by reducing the number of components with a new design, we aim a simplified maintenance, and improved force and thrust to weight ratio.
Open-sourced physic based simulation and successful preliminary flight tests highlighted the tool as promising for future APhI applications.

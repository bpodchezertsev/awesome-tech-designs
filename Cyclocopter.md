Cyclocopter
===========

Also cyclogyro.

Cyclocopter is a copter based on [Cyclorotor](Propulsion.md#cyclorotor) as a main propulsion system.

## UAV



### Cyclotech BlackBird Demonstrator

Full-electric cyclocopter. Also horizontal omnicopter.

Scaled prototype of [Cyclotech CruiseUp](#cyclotech-cruiseup)

Instead of [Cyclotech Technology Demonstrator](#cyclotech-technology-demonstrator) with 4 cyclorotor,
the BlackBird uses 6 in configuration, which allows to move any direction in horizontal plane without yaw.

The BlackBird is a partial (horizontal) omnicopter, as it does not tilt during acceleration/braking/sliding and can move sideways without yaw.

The BlackBird can also be a partial omnicopter, as it can maintain static stability at any pitch angle.

### Cyclotech Technology Demonstrator

Full-electric cyclocopter.

Project highlights thrust-vectoring design similar to [JetQuad](Jetcopter.md#jetquad) or <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-22>.

First scaled prototype developed by Cyclotech.

Demonstrator uses 4 cyclorotors.

Demonstrator has compound helicopter like capabilities, as it does not tilt during acceleration/braking.

Demonstrator can also be a partial single-axis omnicopter (if it has enough thrust),
as it can maintain static stability while rotating 360 degrees on the pitch axis,
but that properties does not tested.

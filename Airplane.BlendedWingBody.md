[Airplane](Airplane.md):Blended Wing Body
=========================================

_BWB list, ordered alphabetically in each group._

A blended wing body (BWB), also known as blended body, hybrid wing body (HWB) or a lifting aerofoil fuselage, is a fixed-wing aircraft having no clear dividing line between the wings and the main body of the craft.

Today we have many BWB UAVs, but we still not have manned BWB aircraft.

This is the list of manned BWB projects:

Airplane
========

I don't see any airplanes actively being developed today (or in the recent past) with an interesting design.
For example, many cool canards/tandems designed by Burt Rutan (or clones) are still available on the market, but there are no other cool designs in development today.
Change my mind.

ps. Ok, ok, I'll put the references to the Icon A5 here <https://www.iconaircraft.com/a5/> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICON_A5>

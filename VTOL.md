VTOL
====

VTOL = Vertical Take Off and Landing.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL>

Many VTOLs have STOL capabilities and in this case can be classified as V/STOL.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V/STOL>

VTOL is the most complex topic, also many prototypes are developed as zero-emission or electric aerial vehicles,
so their construction becomes much more difficult.

### Lilium

Tiltwing

Project highlights a tilted ducted fun array in a pusher configuration.
Since the engines are integrated into the wing, it looks like a partially tilted wing.

Note: Possible cancellation reason is unstability of large scale models.
If instability of large scale models is a possible reason for cancellation, we will never see lift-fan aircraft again.


### Project Zero

Lift-fan.

Status: Cancelled.

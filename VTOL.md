### Abstract

VTOL = Vertical Take Off and Landing.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL>

Many VTOLs have STOL capabilities and in this case can be classified as V/STOL.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V/STOL>

VTOL is the most complex topic, also many prototypes are developed as zero-emission or electric aerial vehicles,
so their construction becomes much more difficult.

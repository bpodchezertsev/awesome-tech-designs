VTOL
====

VTOL = Vertical Take Off and Landing.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL

Many VTOLs have STOL capabilities and in this case can be classified as V/STOL.

VTOL is the most complex topic, also many prototypes are developed as zero-emission or electric aerial vehicles,
so their construction becomes much more difficult.


# Alia

Fixed engine 4/1 eVTOL.

In lieu of other VTOLs, Beta comes with two different configurations in a similar frame: eVTOL and ePlane.

Status: Operated in ePlane configuration.

Certification: Currently FAA certification approved for ePlane configuration.

# Joby

6 engine tilt-rotor.

Hydrogen-fuelled eVTOL with long range abilities.

Project highlights the modern vision of VTOL quadcopter-like projects of 60s. (For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-22).

Certification: FAA certification will begin in 2025.

# Lilium

eVTOL

Project highlights a tilted ducted fun array in a pusher configuration.
Since the engines are integrated into the wing, it looks like a partially tilted wing.

# Valor

Tilt-rotor.

Project highlights engines fixed in place. (Instead of regular tilt-rotor aircraft).

# Project Zero

Lift-fan.

Status: Cancelled.

Top-loss: Last built prototype of lift-fan aircraft

Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgustaWestland_Project_Zero

Note: Possible cancellation reason is unstability of large scale models.
It works well for SUAV, but can't be scaled up.
So, if this is true, we will never see again lift-fan aircraft.

Note: If instability of large scale models is a possible reason for cancellation, we will never see lift-fan aircraft again.

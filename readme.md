Awesome Tech Designs
====================

A list of interesting projects to engage people in cutting-edge technologies that could change the shape of the near future.
This list is currently based on my interests in drones and other aircraft design concepts.

Also, this list shows how difficult it is to develop such projects to make them sustainable projects.

In this list you can also see many inactive or cancelled projects.
You may see some projects that have already tried to be revived after being cancelled, are trying to be revived today, or may try to do so in the future.

How is this list filtered:
- There only actual existing and near future projects (or near past cancelled projects).
- This list does not include awesome historical projects, but maybe has some historical references.
- This list does not include scam, or a possible scam was marked.
- This list does not include non-interesting or non-valuable experimental projects, to not be overloaded,
but maybe some projects will be referenced.

Enjoy!

I don't see there safe and well-designed manned copter. Mainly all of these stuff are manned versions of SUAV copters.
Change my mind.
